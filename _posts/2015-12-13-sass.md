This won't be a huge overview, just an experience with Sass Pre-Processor. Firstly, I never really knew what a Pre-Processor was, so Sass was new and something completely unknown to me recommend via Reddit. In this post, I'll share how I use Sass and it's benefits.

Sass is great, the syntax for scss is pretty easy to learn, assuming you've got a decent grasp on css already. The use of mixins defined by `@mixin` are handy for browser support on certain properties, more so if you're not using an auto-prefixer. Sass also features compass, so you don't have to use gulp if you'd prefer not to.

I love Sass for nesting too, especially for navigations, it makes reading through style sheets much easier when you can hide a huge block of code with one click, because it's all nested. It also makes debugging and actual building faster, at least for me. Once you're over the confusion of nesting and where to use `:hover, :focus` and other pseudo classes, you really get an idea of the power with nesting alone. However, I wouldn't nest where I wouldn't normally want to, it can become very confusing and hinder more than help debugging.

Sass is also great for partials, so you can split up code between multiple files and build into one final (main.css) file for serving. This means less requests, but the flexibility of having multiple stylesheets and not a huge one you're hacking up and spending forever reading for one line. Partials are imported via the `@import` in the main scss sheet.

It's also worth noting about variables, no more listing `font-family` a thousand times, just use a variable! `$primary-font: 'Arial';` and quote `font-family: $primary-font;` in the rest of the style sheet. It's worth keeping these variables at the top of the CSS sheet for quick changing of colors, fonts or timings.

However, depending how you load the `@imports` means if those files can use the variables. You'll need to import the files then define the variables so the imported variables can make use of the variables stated in the main file.
