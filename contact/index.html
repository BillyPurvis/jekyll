          We don't need fancy contact forms, just simple email, phonecall or a cup of coffee to discuss a role you have or think I might be interested in. 

          You can connect with me on LinkedIn too. Or, if you still prefer, you can email me at <a href="mailto:purvisbilly@outlook.com">purvisbilly@outlook.com</a>. After, I'll be more than happy to chat on whatever suits you best.
