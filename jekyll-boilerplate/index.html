			This was one of my favorite projects and it's used in production for my clients and other developers. Jekyll is a static site generator which is perfect for blogging or portfolios. I built a boilerplate that creates a bare Jekyll site which uses gulp and sass along side gulp-plugins to minify, compile and build Jekyll into the production dir ready to be served. It also uses gulp-connect for a localhost.
