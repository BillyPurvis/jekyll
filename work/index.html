		<p class="content-p">
			Lisa Jones Design is a freelance graphic designer from Lincoln. I worked with Lisa to give a new modern site rich with content. The site was designed from an intial breif and I opted to use Jekyll to keep a light weight site, yet easy enough to upload new blog posts using markdown. The site uses Jekyll, Scss, gulp at the core to keep clean and maintainable code.

		<h1 class="content-title">Jekyll Boilerplate</h1>
		<p class="content-p">
			This was one of my favorite projects and it's used in production for my clients and other developers. Jekyll is a static site generator which is perfect for blogging or portfolios. I built a boilerplate that creates a bare Jekyll site which uses gulp and sass along side gulp-plugins to minify, compile and build Jekyll into the production dir ready to be served. It also uses gulp-connect for a localhost.
