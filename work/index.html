			ACTA are an independant organisation created to protect the rights of animals in the film industry. ACAT came to me with ideas to revamp.

		<h1 class="content-title">Jekyll Boilerplate</h1>
		<p class="content-p">
			This was one of my favorite projects and it's used in production for my clients and other developers. Jekyll is a static site generator which is perfect for blogging or portfolios. I built a boilerplate that creates a bare Jekyll site which uses gulp and sass along side gulp-plugins to minify, compile and build Jekyll into the production dir ready to be served. It also uses gulp-connect for a localhost.
